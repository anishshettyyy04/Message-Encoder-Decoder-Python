# Message-Encoder-Decoder-Python
This Python program allows users to encode and decode text messages. For words with three or more characters, it shuffles the first letter to the end and adds random strings at both ends for extra obfuscation. Short words are simply reversed. Includes a simple menu for choosing between encoding and decoding.
